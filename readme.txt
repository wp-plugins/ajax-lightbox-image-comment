To add comments to the photos gallery in a quick and easy way use ajax and lightbox

== Description ==

DEMO

This is a perfect solution for people who base their blog/website on a large amount of added images in the gallery.
WordPress plugin allows you to open the photo gallery in the popular "Lightbox " and to add comments to these pictures in a quick and simple way,
it is similar solution to this used in the popular Facebook. Thanks to this application it is not necessary to enter each sub with photo to comment,
add your own mind etc. You can see it immediately after loading images to the Lightbox. 

the plugin allows us to:

*   Open the photos in the lightboxes
*   Show comments for each pictures
*   Add your own comments in a quickly way 


Of course, the plugin uses the functionality of WordPress, therefore all restrictions operate on this WordPress plugin.
For example: It is not possible to add two the same comments, add comments one after the another one in too short time etc.
All limits are taken from WordPress. 



== Installation ==

1 Download the plugin

2 Activate the plugin on your blog

3 Create photo gallery on the website

5 finished :) 

* jQuery library required

Make sure that before the gallery there is class alic-comments such as:
&lt;div class="alic-comments"&gt; [gallery ids="5,6,7,8,9,10,18"]&lt;/div&gt;
